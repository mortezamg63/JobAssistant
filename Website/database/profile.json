GPT-4o-mini's performance (average price difference) with RAG, improves from 80.9 to 55.57. I fine-tuned Llama3.1-8B and achieved 46.67 average error. I developed an agent that creates an ensemble model combining RAG+GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned Llama, and Random forest, achieving 54.62 error. I use a Gradio-based UI and integrated Pushover API for real-time deal alerts from DealNews.Com"
