Created and managed a repository featuring data science and machine learning projects. These projects involve
working with various datasets, addressing challenges suitable for beginner to intermediate levels in data science. The
repository includes:
• Data processing and preprocessing
• Exploring data analysis (EDA)
• Feature engineering and selection
• Machine learning development and evaluation
• Data visualization and interpretation
Large Language Models | HuggingFace, Pytorch, Pandas, Dask, LangChain, PEFT, RAY, OpenAI APIs
 GitHub
In this repository, I investigate the realm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, embedding models,
prompt engineering, and fine-tuning large language models. Throughout this journey, I am learning about
Generative AI and leveraging some embedding models for practical applications. The repository showcases my
ongoing exploration in this exciting field and will be continually updated with new insights and findings.

 GitHub
An autonomous price estimation framework using LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude, Llama 3.1-8B) and traditional ML
models (Random Forest, SVM, Word2Vec). GPT-4o-mini's performance (average price difference) with RAG,
improves from 80.9 to 55.57. I fine-tuned Llama3.1-8B and achieved 46.67 average error. I developed an agent
that creates an ensemble model combining RAG+GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned Llama, and Random Forest, achieving
54.62 error. I use a Gradio-based UI and integrated Pushover API for real-time deal alerts from DealNews.Com.
SAWTAB: Tabular Data and Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) | Pytorch, Tensorflow, Tensorboard, Scikit-learn,
Matplotlib, Seaborn
This research project focuses on addressing two significant challenges in machine learning with large tabular
datasets: class imbalance and the difficulties associated with one-hot encoding for high-cardinality categorical
features. To overcome these challenges, a target encoding method is proposed for a Semi-Supervised Learning
(SSL) setting. The method improves target encoding by leveraging unlabeled data through pseudo-labels and
adaptively adjusting their influence to minimize the impact of noisy pseudo-labels. Experimental results on various
datasets, compared against multiple frameworks, demonstrate that the approach achieves superior generalization
performance.
