This project involves detecting vehicles using the YOLOv3 model and tracking them using a Kalman Filter. The vehicle detection is carried out using OpenCV and a deep learning framework, which processes images to identify and label detected objects. The Kalman Filter is utilized to track these detected vehicles by predicting their movement and updating this prediction with new measurements, thus maintaining a consistent tracking of object movement within a scene.
