The project involves a texture segmentation algorithm that utilizes Gabor filters and k-means clustering. The approach is broken down into three main steps: the decomposition of an input image using a filter bank with two-dimensional Gabor filters, feature extraction, and clustering. The Gabor filters are characterized by parameters such as wavelength, orientation, phase offset, spatial aspect ratio, and standard deviation to effectively decompose the image. In feature extraction, a nonlinear sigmoidal function is applied, and the average absolute deviation is computed for each filtered image. The k-means clustering algorithm then groups the extracted features by initializing random centroids, assigning data points to the nearest centroid, recalculating centroids, and iterating until convergence. The final segmentation result is color-coded and displayed.
