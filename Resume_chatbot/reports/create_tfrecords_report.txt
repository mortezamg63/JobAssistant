This repository contains a project focused on efficiently preparing large-scale image datasets for machine learning tasks using TensorFlow-slim. It includes a script, `create_tfrecord.py`, that converts datasets into TFRecord format, which is essential for setting up an efficient input pipeline in TensorFlow. Users must configure paths, validation sizes, shard numbers, and output filenames. The `dataset_utils.py` provides supplementary utility functions to handle image data and labels effectively. The README file outlines the setup requirements, including Python and TensorFlow versions, and offers guidance on structuring datasets and running the main script. A separate branch is available for Python 3 compatibility.
