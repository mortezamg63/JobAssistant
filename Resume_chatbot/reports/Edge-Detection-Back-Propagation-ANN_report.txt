This project implements an edge detection algorithm using a Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP ANN) in Matlab, inspired by the article "Novel Edge Detection Using BP Neural Network Based on Threshold Binarization." The code initializes neural network parameters, trains the network to minimize error, and applies edge detection to grayscale images, displaying the results. For further details, consult the article.
