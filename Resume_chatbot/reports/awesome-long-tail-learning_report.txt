The repository is a comprehensive resource on long-tail learning, with a focus on datasets where class labels follow a long-tailed or power-law distribution. It compiles related papers and resources, particularly in the domains of computer vision and extreme multi-label learning (XML). The repository is organized into topics such as long-tailed learning methods, semi-supervised learning, learning with noisy labels, out-of-distribution detection, federated learning, and various XML methods like binary relevance, tree-based methods, and embedding-based methods. Additionally, it includes links to workshops and papers for further exploration of long-tailed learning.
