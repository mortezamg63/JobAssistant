This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the paper "Supervised Autoencoders: Improving Generalization Performance with Unsupervised Regularizers." It demonstrates the effects of utilizing supervised autoencoders on the CIFAR10 and SUSY datasets, focusing on how different weights for prediction and reconstruction losses influence test accuracy. The repository includes experimental results illustrated with graphs.
