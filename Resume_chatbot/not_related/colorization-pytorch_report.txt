The repository is a PyTorch reimplementation of an interactive image colorization project. It focuses on enabling real-time, user-guided image colorization using deep learned priors. The project begins with automatic colorization through classification loss and fine-tunes a model for interactive colorization using regression loss. It requires Python and PyTorch, and uses the ILSVRC 2012 dataset for training. The repository includes scripts for setting up datasets, testing and evaluating models, and training processes. Various support files define how datasets are handled, detail neural network setup, and configure training options. Additional utilities facilitate dataset downloads, HTML report generation, and manage image pools for training diversity. The project appears to involve conversion work from a Caffe backend to PyTorch, aiming for performance in deep neural network-driven image colorization tasks.
