The repository offers a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and PyTorch models designed to reproduce figures from the paper "Deep Image Prior." It focuses on image processing tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, and restoration of JPEG-compressed images. The codebase includes implementations of various neural network architectures including ResNet, U-Net, and DCGAN, providing a configurable framework for deep learning experiments in image restoration and enhancement. Utilities are provided for managing network modules, handling noise, and processing images, facilitating an empirical exploration of the deep image prior concept. Installation instructions for required libraries like PyTorch and matplotlib are also included.
