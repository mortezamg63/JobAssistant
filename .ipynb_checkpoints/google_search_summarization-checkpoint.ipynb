    "Etched is building AI chips that are hard-coded for individual model architectures. Our first product (Sohu) only supports transformers, but has an order of magnitude more throughput and lower latency than a B200. With Etched ASICs, you can build products that would be impossible with GPUs, like real-time video generation models and extremely deep chain-of-thought reasoning.\n",

    "Backed by $150M+ in funding from investors like Peter Thiel, Jane Street, and Two Sigma, we're scaling rapidly and looking for exceptional interns to join us in Summer 2025. Interns will get to work on cutting-edge engineering and business challenges across the following departments at Etched:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardware Engineering (ASIC):\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Hardware team is designing next-generation silicon that runs transformer models faster than any chip in history. Led by Ajat Hukkoo (ex-Broadcom Distinguished Engineer, Intel VP) and Mark Ross (former Cypress CTO; shipped 5 different $1B+ silicon systems), our Hardware team is looking for excellent electrical and computer engineers to help us design and verify our next-gen silicon.\n",

    "Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Architecture team, led by Saptadeep Pal (Co-founder/Chief Architect at Auradine, ex-NVIDIA architecture team), is designing the underlying chip architecture for our silicon. Architecture interns will help solve novel challenges in microarchitecture design to drive unprecedented FLOPS on our chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Platform team is led by Brian Loiler, NVIDIA's former Senior Director of Datacenter Systems Engineering who built multiple generations of DGX and HGX. Scaling from single chips to full datacenter deployments requires solving complex challenges in thermal design, power delivery, system integration, and more. We're looking for exceptional electrical and mechanical engineers to join the Platform team and help us build state-of-the-art systems at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software Engineering and Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Software and Machine Learning teams build firmware, inference engines, and model infrastructure for Sohu. Our stack is engineered to optimize transformer performance - enabling capabilities that are impossible on general-purpose chips. The team is led by David Munday, who helped lead data center and TPU infrastructure at Google and DeepMind for 7 years. We're looking for leading SWEs and machine learning researchers across a variety of roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations team is our special forces unit, working on the company's most critical business initiatives alongside our COO, Robert Wachen. We tackle problems through rigorous analysis, strategic planning, and relentless execution. We're looking for sharp, ambitious interns who can thrive under pressure, take complete ownership of complex problems, and deliver measurable results.\n",
